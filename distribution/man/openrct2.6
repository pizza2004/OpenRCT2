.Sh DESCRIPTION
OpenRCT2 is an open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 (RCT2).
The gameplay revolves around building and maintaining an amusement park
containing attractions, shops and facilities. The player must try to make a
profit and maintain a good park reputation whilst keeping the guests happy.
OpenRCT2 allows for both scenario and sandbox play. Scenarios require the
player to complete a certain objective in a set time limit whilst sandbox
allows the player to build a more flexible park with optionally no
restrictions or finance.

.Sh HISTORY
RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 was originally written by Chris Sawyer in x86 assembly
and is the sequel to RollerCoaster Tycoon. The engine was based on
Transport Tycoon, an older game which also has an equivalent open-source
project, OpenTTD. OpenRCT2 attempts to provide everything from RCT2 as well as
many improvements and additional features, some of these include support for
modern platforms, an improved interface, improved guest and staff AI, more
editing tools, increased limits, and cooperative multiplayer. It also
re-introduces mechanics from RollerCoaster Tycoon that were not present in
RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. Some of those include; mountain tool in-game, the
"have fun" objective, launched coasters (not passing-through the station) and
several buttons on the toolbar.
